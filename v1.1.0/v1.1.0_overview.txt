Current configuration and related issues

MAIN PCB
* BOOT/EN buttons
      - D0/IO0 ie PIN25 is not connected to the BOOT button

* Heater/Fan SSR
      - Fan is at D34/IO34, which is input only, needs to be moved to D22/IO22

* Buttons on casing
      - Need to add buttons, IO4, IO35, IO34, and connect two more to BOOT and EN

* Need to add Buzzer at D5/IO5

* Thermocouple Amplifier MAX6675 
      - Current footprint is too small, possibly for the obsolete version of this part
      - Notch is needed on the footprint to identify orientation

* Diodes at IO2, HEAT, FAN and 3V3
      - Need to add LEDs at power traces for easier trouble shooting, sign them

* CP2102 USB/UART Bridge
      - Notch is needed on the footprint to identify orientation
      - Pad of the CP2102 was ungrounded which prevented it from properly functioning, need to ground the pad
      - Need to separate USB/UART into a separate board for easier troubleshooting/replacement

* JST Connectors
      - Power Board
      - LCD Screen, need to separate 9P connector into two with smaller pin number
      - LCD Touch
      - SD Card, currently not implemented
      - E-Fan
      - Need 3P JST to transfer 5V if supplied by the USB connection
      - Need JST for the original LEDs of the oven
      - Need to sign all connector pins for easy wiring

* Screw Mounts for thermocouple probes

* 41791 Connectors for HEAT and FAN
      - Need to replace with JST

* Through Hole Buttons for BOOT and EN

* ESP-WROOM-32
* 0805 CAP/RES
* 2.54" for connectors
* USB-A
* Ground pour isolation 20mil
* Trace width 20mil


POWER PCB
* Linear voltage regulators 12/5 and 5/3v3 - LM1117
      - Need to eplace 12/5 with switching regulator if size is acceptable, LM2575 possibly

* 9VAC/12VDC voltage rectifier usin 1n4007

* JST Connectors
      - AC supply
      - Main PCB
      - Need to move them on the edge of the board
      - Need 3P JST to receive 5V from the USB

* Switch
      - Currently 5V trace is shared between AC supply and USB connection, need to add a switch to only use one at a time

* 0805 CAP/RES
      - Need to replace 0805 - 100uF capacitor with a through hole footprint

* 2.54" for connectors
* Ground pour isolation 20mil
* Trace width 40mil
