Current configuration and related issues

MAIN PCB
* BOOT/EN buttons
      - D0/IO0 connected to the BOOT button
      - Through hole buttons on the PCB

* Heater/Fan SSR
      - Fan is at D34/IO34 moved to D22/IO22

* Buttons on casing connected to IO4, IO35, IO34, BOOT and EN
* Buzzer at D5/IO5
* Diodes at IO2, HEAT, FAN, 12V, 5V, 3V3; all signed on the silkscreen

* Thermocouple Amplifier MAX6675 
      - Fixed the footprint
      - Made orientation notch visible

* JST Connectors
      - Power Board
      - LCD Screen
      - LCD Touch
      - SD Card, currently not implemented
      - E-Fan
      - 5V USB to Power Board
      - Original LEDs of the oven
      - All the pins signed
      - Need to add another connector at 12V for second E-Fan

* Screw Mounts for thermocouple probes

* ESP-WROOM-32
* 0805 CAP/RES
* 2.54" for connectors
* Ground pour isolation 20mil
* Trace width 24mil


POWER PCB
* Linear voltage regulator 5/3v3 - LM1117
* Switching voltage regulator 12/5 - LM2575
      - Need to replace with LM2575 for higher current ceiling

* 9VAC/12VDC voltage rectifier usin 1n4007

* JST Connectors
      - AC supply
      - Main PCB
      - Main PCB 5V from USB/UART
      - Need to move them on the edge of the board
      - Need 3P JST to receive 5V from the USB

* Switch
      - Currently 5V trace is shared between AC supply and USB connection, need to add a switch to only use one at a time

* 0805 CAP/RES
      - Need to replace 0805 - 100uF capacitor with a through hole footprint

* 2.54" for connectors
* Ground pour isolation 20mil
* Trace width 40mil


USB/UART PCB
-Needs to be built
* CP2102 USB/UART Bridge
      - Notch is needed on the footprint to identify orientation
      - Pad of the CP2102 was ungrounded which prevented it from properly functioning, need to ground the pad
      - Need to separate USB/UART into a separate board for easier troubleshooting/replacement
