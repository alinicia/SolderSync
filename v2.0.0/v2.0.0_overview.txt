* Modified Initial Schematics
* Autodesk Fusion 360

* Complete Main PCB, Power PCB, USB/UART PCB
* PCB specific schematics

* Currently not enough GPIOs to run old buttons
* No SD-Card Support


MAIN PCB
* Thermocouple Amplifier MAX6675 
      - Current footprint is too small, possibly for the obsolete version of this part
      - Notch is needed on the footprint to identify orientation

* Diodes at IO2, HEAT, FAN and 3V3
      - Notch is needed on the footprint to identify orientation

* CP2102 USB/UART Bridge
      - Notch is needed on the footprint to identify orientation

* JST Connectors
      - Power Board
      - LCD Screen, need to separate 9P connector into two with smaller pin number
      - LCD Touch
      - SD Card, currently not implemented
      - E-Fan

* Screw Mounts for thermocouple probes

* 41791 Connectors for HEAT and FAN
      - Replace with JST Possibly

* Through Hole Buttons for BOOT and EN

* ESP-WROOM-32
* 0805 CAP/RES
* 2.54" for connectors
* USB-A
* Ground pour isolation 20mil
* Trace width 20mil


POWER PCB
* Linear voltage regulators 12/5 and 5/3v3 - LM1117
      - Need to eplace 12/5 with switching regulator if size is acceptable, LM2575 possibly

* 9VAC/12VDC voltage rectifier usin 1n4007

* JST Connectors
      - AC supply
      - Main PCB
      - Need to move them on the edge of the board

* 0805 CAP/RES
      - Need to replace 0805 - 100uF capacitor with a through hole footprint

* 2.54" for connectors
* Ground pour isolation 20mil
* Trace width 40mil
